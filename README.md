# Oumar-Assignment1-2_DNP1


Minimum requirement

This assignment is open-ended, meaning that the minimum requirements are few, but there is plenty of room to expand upon the assignment, if you wish to challenge yourself. See optional suggestions in the next section.

As a minimum, you must be able to:

1. Register, log in, and out

2. Create a new post (when logged in), containing a title and a body (create a new page for this, when you have learned Blazor)

3. View all posts, i.e. just a Title (either use the front page or create a new page, when you have learned Blazor)

4. Click on a post in the post overview, to go to a new page, where you can view the entire post (when you have learned Blazor).

So, what you can start with, is do the Web API part, which needs to e.g. handle POST requests for user and post, and GET requests for a list of post headers, and GET request for a single post.

In the second part, you have been introduced to Blazor, and can do the pages.

Assignment 2

In this second part you create a Blazor WASM client. Assignment 1 covered the Web API, so we are now ready to add a client as well.
